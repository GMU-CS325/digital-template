# GMU CS325 Introduction to Game Design

This repository is a simple "hello, world!" template for a game made with Phaser.
All the code lives in the `gh-pages` branch. This lets you run your games directly from github!
Check it out: http://gmu-cs325.github.io/digital-template/
Fork this repository, checkout the `gh-pages` branch, and start making your own game!

You can't run the `index.html` directly from your local machine without a local webserver.
If you try, the images won't load (your browser will prevent it, thinking it is malicious).
To get around this, use python (enter the directory and type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
or install [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org/) and the `http-server` package,
and then type `http-server` from inside the directory.
