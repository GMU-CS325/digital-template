<h2>Souls</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a soul reaper who is gathering souls
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to expierence a puzzle type of platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game would be categorized under platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
    In this game the player will use arrow keys to control the character. You must collect the blue souls. If you touch a skull, you will die and the game is over. You must also collect all souls before the time is up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the ability to move around the surroundings of the map. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game takes an element from mario where you have to collect coins. The coins are flying around the map along with the skulls. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story, summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This game can be completed within 90 seconds 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I suggest the player to jump to the side of the map that doesnt have the giant skulls and collect the souls there and jump over the skulls if you have to get the rest. Try not to go to a corner of the map when a skull is going toward you.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used the getting started example from phaser to get started 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The Getting started example is close to this game except that the object to collect flies all over the map.
</li>
