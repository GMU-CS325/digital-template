<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid the dodgeballs for as long as you can. Your character follows the mouse.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A slowly incrementing difficulty that changes seemlessly from easy to incredibly hard, and gets harder and harder the longer the player can last.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade/Survival
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can dodge the balls by moving the mouse. Sticking to a corner could be a solid tactic, but moving around allows more freedom of maneuverability.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Mouse aversion.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
While some games typically make difficulty harder by levels, waves, etc., this game is made difficult constantly over time, rather than by an increment every few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're playing as Ed, he's in gym class and is trying to avoid being knocked out in an increasingly difficult dodgeball game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
It's an arcade game; there is very little story besides the above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casuals.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes depending on how skilled the player is.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Hugging corners for more experienced players who figure out how to last a decent amount of time by not moving, and weaving in an out of the predicted patterns of the dodgeballs for others.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used the template model for the movement of Ed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Robotron
